**bibhabasumohapatra/bibhabasumohapatra** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on  Kaggle Competitions - Sartorius - Cell Instance Segmentation  AND Jigsaw Rate Severity of Toxic Comments 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning lot about Self Supervised and Energy based Things. Interested in unifying all Energies, Bayesian, GAN Planning, and Diffusions 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to work in Research Internships - and Data Science Internships
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Natural Language Processing and MLOps

## PyTorchian, Computer Vision, NLP, Quantitative Mathematics, Data Science 

### About me: I  don't overfit xgboost, and train my transformers. 
 #### I am a movie person on the weekends and Deep Learner and Machine Learner on the weekdays ,I discuss ml stuff on Kaggle...and try to engage in discussions as much as possible. I try lot of kaggle competitions and learn from kaggle competitions.              Currently undergrad at IIIT Bhubaneswar in Computer Science and Engineering.
 #### Focussing on Deep Learning and its application in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing...

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Medical Images Like Radiology and Whole Slide Tissue Images
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning lot of stuff and especially interested in  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to work in Research Internships - and Data Science Internships
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Natural Language Processing and MLOps
#### Kaggle Participation :
